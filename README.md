##### There are 4 Notebooks:
- EAD_plots_only_teams.ipynb to do data exploration and produce plots
- EAD_plots_novos_teams.ipynb to do data exploration and produce plots
- ProjectNotebook.ipynb with the detailed project steps we followed
- Prediction11.ipynb with another aproach to the dataset for each individual player/coach

The final prediction for year 11 we got is from the ProjectNotebook.ipynb because the models had better accuracy than with the Prediction11.ipynb aproach.
